> Uptime monitor created using vanilla nodejs


## ðŸŽ¯ About

This is a very mini backend that can tract a website up or down. I tried to use only nodejs no external libraries. The main goal was to see the power of vanila nodejs. I have another version of it that i use for my company that sends SMS alerts using our sms api. In future hopeing to implement a front end for it to make it easy to use
